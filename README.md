- 👋 Hi, I’m @aliicev!
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in front-end programming, but I often find myself in the back-end "forest".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new ways to personalize the look and feel of my environment, and to improve the overall security systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Office Suite programming possibilities, HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, User Control & Authorization.
- ✨ Thank you!
